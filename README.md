**Running Your React Web Application**

To start your React web application and see it running in your browser, follow these steps:

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - **Windows:** Press the Windows key, search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell," and open it.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open your terminal application (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2).

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to change directories to the folder containing your React project. In this example, the folder is named `my-canvas-app`. Replace it with the actual name of your project directory.

   ```bash
   cd my-canvas-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
